# Introduction
This is a very simple app written as a more interesting guide to get someone with *ZERO* programming background to get started. The app is written as a game. Basic options are for the player to attempt to capture/recruit a unit, view their units, and finally quit. The capture process is set at 50% where a "dice" is simulated by a randomizer and the a successful catch is performed when an even number is returned.

## Concepts covered
### Variables
All units are intentionally named as A, B, C, etc. The user is free to enter and update within the code on how they wish to name their units. They could also update the names of the variables and see its impact. Also they would also be able to gain experience on strings within programming.

### Functions/Methods
The actions are intentionally named as generic universal options. User is encouraged rename the functions into something more informative based on the actions they wish to have within the game.

### Mathematical Operations
1. Using variables to calculate statistics of success rate
1. Adjusting randomization for probability of success

### Time
1. Understanding concept of time/controls

### Data Structure
1. Adding/removing from a list

### Programming
1. Extending functionality of actions
1. Saving/Loading of information to a file

## Exclusions

1. User Interface (all programs starts from command prompt!)
1. Logging
1. Configs
1. Classes (while it could improve the code but this is an INTRODUCTION!)
1. All other advanced topics (this is meant as an INTRODUCTION!)
